# Calculating the Temporal Decay of *g*<sup>(1)</sup>(*t*) Using Python

## Objective

This repository aims to demonstrate how to extract the fringe contrast from an interferogram and calculate the temporal decay of the first-order correlation function *g*<sup>(1)</sup>(*t*).

The code was developed by [Konstantinos Orfanakis](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=U5drfBUAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Dr Hamid Ohadi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=x6E7md4AAAAJ&hl=en) at the University of St Andrews and was extensively used for our first publication ([Phys. Rev. B 103, 235313 (2021)](https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.103.235313)).
